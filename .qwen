If anything is unclear, ask questions before proceeding.

Before making changes, evaluate multiple possible approaches and choose the best one.

Identify all impacted code, tests, documentation, and tooling, and account for required updates.

Create a clear plan.

Execute in small, verifiable steps, validating results as you go.

If making code changes, compile and run tests (and add or update tests as needed) before declaring success.
