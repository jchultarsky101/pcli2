//! Custom exit codes for the PCLI2 application

//! This module defines specific exit codes for different error conditions

/// These codes follow the BSD sysexits.h conventions where possible:
/// - 0: Success
/// - 64-78: Standard exit codes from sysexits.h
/// - 100+: Custom application-specific codes
